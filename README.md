## What this React App Does: 

*This React App fetches information from a free weather data API service (https://openweathermap.org/api)

*Current weather information is rendered to the React single-pg-app based on the users current location

*Note that this weather app fails to fetch the API data in XML form as I was unable to convert the returned XML to JSON*
